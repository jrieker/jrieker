## Hey, I'm Jacob 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln with a strong focus on fullstack development, game design, and backend architecture. I’ve built complete projects ranging from competitive multiplayer games to structured web applications, and I’m especially passionate about combining technical skills with creative design to build polished, user-driven experiences.

### 🏀 STREETBALL — A Competitive Basketball Game  
My most advanced project to date — STREETBALL is a fast-paced 5v5 game featuring story mode, battle pass progression, cosmetic systems, matchmaking, and a custom shop. The entire project was designed, coded, and built independently.

- Integrated quest system, stat tracking, leaderboards, and achievements  
- Custom UI for every feature: shop, player profile, battle pass, XP system  
- Designed for performance, competitive play, and replayability

### 💼 Career Goals  
I’m working toward a role in **software development** or **fullstack engineering**, where I can apply both backend logic and front-end structure to real-world products. I pick things up quickly and enjoy learning new tools and frameworks by applying them directly to the projects I build. I'm especially interested in environments that value ownership, technical clarity, and creativity.
