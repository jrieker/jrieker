## Hey, I’m Jacob

I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln with a focus on software development, game design, and backend architecture. I like building things that are actually fun to use — whether that’s a full-featured web app or a competitive multiplayer game.

### STREETBALL — Competitive Basketball Game  
A fast-paced 5v5 game I built solo on Roblox. It includes story mode, a full battle pass system, cosmetic unlocks, and custom matchmaking.

- Designed and scripted every feature, from stat tracking to UI  
- Built quest system, XP progression, shop, and player profiles  
- Focused on performance and competitive replayability

A full league experience built in Roblox with real broadcasters, crowd systems, and weekly games featuring up to 40+ players.

- Handled all game logic: teams, roles, spectating, scoring, and stat tracking  
- Built custom uniforms, helmets, intros, and audio elements  
- Produced media content like intros, highlights, and full broadcasts

### Card Games Project  
Right now, I’m building a web app for Solitaire and Blackjack using React and C# with a vertical iDesign-style architecture.

- Separate verticals for each game (UserAccount, Solitaire, Blackjack)  
- Login, account management, and game selection are set up  
- Backend built with ASP.NET Core and SQL

### What I Work With  
- **Languages/Frameworks**: C#, React, ASP.NET Core, SQL, Lua  
- **Game Dev**: Roblox Studio scripting and asset design  
- **Architecture**: iDesign vertical structure (Manager, Engine, Accessor)  
- **UI/UX**: Clean interfaces focused on how users actually use stuff

### What I’m Looking For  
I’m aiming for a role in software development or fullstack engineering — somewhere I can take ownership, contribute to real products, and keep leveling up by doing meaningful work. I’m not afraid to build from scratch, learn on the go, and dive deep into what I don’t know yet.
